# CudaPlayground

A 2D physics engine built from scratch to learn C++ and CUDA.

## Goals

- Learn modern C++ through hands-on project
- Understand physics simulation fundamentals
- Master CUDA parallel programming
- Build something that scales to millions of particles

## Current Status

Work in Progress - Phase 1

See [detailed roadmap](docs/roadmap.md) for full development plan.

## Building

Requires:
- CMake 3.15+
- C++17 compiler
- (GPU not required for early phases)
```bash
mkdir build && cd build
cmake ..
make
./TEST1
```

## Learning Journey

This is my first serious C++/CUDA project. The goal is to learn by building something real and useful.
